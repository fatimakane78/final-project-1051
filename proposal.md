## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

No collaborations

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will have my app be able to add and delete a contact, that's the least the app will do. Using all the modules we have learned in this class to execute this app.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Having the app do all the things that I would like it to do, add, search, edit, and a delete a contact.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Having the app do all the things that I would like it to do, add, search, edit, and a delete a contact. I will also see if I can also allow the app to add a picture to the contact

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to make sure I can work with a csv file, since it is different then a text file. I will also need to make sure I can make changes to this csv file. Then if I want to this even better, I would also need to make sure I can add a photo to a csv file for a contact (not sure how I will be able to do it).
