# final-project-1051

Addressbook:

This project is a addressbook project. Here, we'll be essentially creating a vcf file in the code. The user would first input an contact to a vcard file. Whenerver the user adds a contact, it will continue to add another contact. The user would be able to add a contact, search a specific contact, and print all contacts. 

Down below is a link to a video.
