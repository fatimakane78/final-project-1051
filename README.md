# final-project-1051

Address Book:
This project is a addressbook project. Here, we'll be essentially creating a vcf file in the code. The user would first input an contact to a vcard file. Whenerver the user adds a contact, it will continue to add another contact. The user would be able to add a contact, search a specific contact, and print all contacts. 


Disclaimer:
In order for this project to work, you would need to first create a vcf file; ex. greg.vcf or bella.vcf. AFter that file is created, the python code and the vcf file have to be in the same folder (if you ware using my addressbook.vcf file for a test run, then just make sure it is in the same folder as the python code). After both files are in the same folder you'll just open the folder in your editor (IDLE, etc). That vcf that's in that folder you created, will be the vcf file you'll work on. SO now you should have the oython code and the vcf you created (or just use the one I have).  After those tasks are done, then you can be able to add, search, or print all functions. It is recommened to add a contact first before seaching or printing all contacts.
